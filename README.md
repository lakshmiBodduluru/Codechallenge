# .NET Code Challenge

The Application has a controller which is also the default controller, with a Get API that does the job.


### At Home
* I have limited my time to do the exrcise. I did not have time to write test cases for the controller, I ran past 2 hours by the time I completed until here.
* I did not check in the changes as and when I made them, but doing a checkin at the stage where there are not test cases for the controller.
* I am submitting this exercise thinking that it would suffice explaining the actual goal of this exercise (The goal of this challenge is not to complete the exercise, but to give us an understanding on how you tackle problems. Please talk us through your thinking process & assumptions as you go.)
