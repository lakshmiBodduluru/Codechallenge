# .NET Code Challenge

The project has a controller which is the default controller, and the get api does the intended job of fetching the horse with price in ascending order.


### At Home
* I have limited my time to do the exercise. I did not have time to write test cases for the controller, I just ran past 2 hours by the time I completed until here.
* I did not check in the changes as and when I made them, but doing a checkin at this stage where there I have developed the api and the related business logic but with no test cases for the controller.
* I am submitting this exercise thinking that it would suffice explaining the actual goal of this exercise (The goal of this challenge is not to complete the exercise, but to give us an understanding on how you tackle problems. Please talk us through your thinking process & assumptions as you go.)
